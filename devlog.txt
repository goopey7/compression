Finally got around to making a green eggs and ham compressor. The way it works currently is just by mapping frequently
used words and phrases to arbitrary characters. Next I need to implement the ability decompress the compressed file.
Maybe for jokes since it technically follows the rules, I'll make a 0-byte compression mode since there's nothing stopping
me from putting green eggs and ham into the source code :)

Plan for tomorrow is to start and finish the decompressor for green eggs and ham, and then move onto a universal text
compressor. Or maybe I'll make a universal file compressor??
